        <div class="jumbotron" style="background:white;">
            <h5 class="text-center">How do I sign up?</h5><br><hr width=70%>
<p class="text-justify">You can use your Facebook account or email to sign up to Cruize in seconds.

In fact, if you use your Facebook, it takes just one tap to create your Cruize account. And even if you prefer to sign up with your email, you only have to enter your name, gender and birth year.

From the homepage, just go to Sign up, follow the instructions and you’re away!</p><br>
        <h5 class="text-center">Why do I need to write a bio?</h5> <br><hr width=70%> 
<p class="text-justify">It’s your chance to add a personal touch to your Profile. Mention things like your profession, hobbies, likes/dislikes or be more specific about what kind of ride you prefer (quiet or karaoke!) and one reason why you carpool.

A bio is a conversation starter. Increasing trust between members. Helping you learn about someone before hitting the road. A little extra info goes a long way towards putting people at ease.</p><br>
<h5 class="text-center">How do I edit my ride?</h5><br><hr width=70%>
<p class="text-justify">As long as you haven’t got any bookings, you’re free to edit your ride as much as you want. Your Ride plan is the place to go. From here, you can edit:<br>

- the itinerary, date and time.<br>

- the number of passengers you can take and whether they’ll be two maximum in the back.<br>

- how you accept bookings (instantly or manually).<br>

- your message for passengers.<br>

- the price.<br>

You can’t edit everything once a passenger books. But, you can still edit the approval mode, number of seats available and your message for passengers.
<br>
Wondering how to get to the Ride plan? Tap on the ride from your Rides when using the app. If you’re using our desktop site, go to Rides offered and select Manage ride and passengers.</p><br>
        <h5 class="text-center">Where can I find more details about my ride and the passengers who have booked?</h5><hr width=70%>    
        <p class="text-justify">You can check out the itinerary of you and your passengers from your Ride plan. All you need to do is select the ride in question from your Rides.

From your Ride plan, you can:<br>

- check out your schedule (exact departure, arrival, stopovers and ETA).<br>

- see a list of booked passengers, including their itinerary.<br>

- edit your ride.<br>

After selecting a passenger, you can see how many seats they’ve booked, the amount you’ll get for the booking. You can also contact them or cancel the booking.</p>
