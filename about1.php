        <p class="lead">Carpooling also creates a unique space, enabling exchanges between people who might have never met otherwise but who come together to share a ride.
 Bringing People Closer is the largest study conducted on the social impacts of carpooling and reveals the social ties created by carpooling.
In Entering the Trust Age, a study conducted jointly with NYU Stern, you can learn about the digital trust tools that have enabled Cruize to create trust at scale and enable millions of people to share long-distance journeys.
Cruize doubles the occupancy rate of cars whilst operating a carbon-saving network. In total, 1.6 million tonnes of CO2 were saved by Cruize carpoolers in 2018, thanks to the relative efficiency of filled cars versus alternative modes of transport, membersâ€™ improved driving behaviors whilst carpooling, and the informal carpooling inspired by Cruize outside the platform.
