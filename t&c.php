            <h5 class="text-muted"><b>3. Insurance</b></h5><hr>
        <p class="text-justify">The Car Owner agrees and undertakes to take out and maintain a comprehensive insurance to cover third party liability, the occupants of the Vehicle and the Trip offered or booked through the Site. The Car Owner agrees that they will, on request, provide the Co-Traveler with evidence, in advance of the Trip, of the complete validity of its insurance policy. The Car Owner also undertakes to hold a valid driving licence and that the Car Owner will own or will be entitled to use the Vehicle and that the Vehicle will have a valid PUC (Pollution Under Control) certificate and the Co-Traveler is entitled to request evidence of the Car Owner’s insurance, registration certificate (‘log book’), driving licence and PUC certificate at any time up to completion of the Trip.<br>

It is Cruize understanding that governmental authorities take the view that a Co-Traveler who contributes only towards travel expenses is treated as travelling without hire or reward to the driver, and is therefore a third party passenger who is covered by comprehensive third party insurance policy in India. However Cruize gives no warranty or assurance in this regard and it is the Car Owner’s responsibility to verify that their insurance provides adequate cover.<br>

It is up to each Car Owner and Co-Traveler to confirm with each other that the Car Owner is covered by valid insurance. The Car Owner must confirm that their insurance policy allows them to carry Co-Travelers and that their insurance policy covers all Co-Travelers and any accident or incident which may occur during a Trip.</p>   <br>
